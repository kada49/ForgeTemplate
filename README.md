# Template for a Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 Mod - NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT


## Usage
This guide works with JetBrains' [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

There are many ways to use templates, choose the method that fits you best

1. First Method
    * Click on the `Code` button [here](https://github.com/asbyth/ForgeTemplate), then click "Download ZIP".
    * Extract the folder from the ZIP folder and open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Second Method
    * Click on the `Use this template` button [here](https://github.com/asbyth/ForgeTemplate).
    * Create your own project.
    * In IntelliJ IDEA open the project by copying your repository's URL, clicking `Get from VCS`, paste the URL and click `Clone`.

When you opened the project replace the mod's name - `ForgeTemplate` and the mod id - `forgetemplate`.
If you use IntelliJ IDEA you can find these entries by typing `ctrl`+`shift`+`f`.
